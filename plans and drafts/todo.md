1 [x] add title fields to post (or find another way to include a title)

2 [x] sort out bug (first letter typed does not render)

3 [x] look through extensions, plan

4 [x] sort out styling

5 [x] create a folder to contain functions that do not return any html, and purely aim to handle data - move GET, POST, PUT requests into individual files in said folder

6 [x] add a DELETE request in the folder created in 5

7 [x] import requests where appropriate, check that functionalities are implemented properly

8 [x] clean-up: go through the code, identify duplicates, empty folders, unecessary components, and refactor appropriately

9 [ ] wish I knew how to go about optimising things - loading the page triggers a whole bunch of fetch requests, and the Lighthouse report is not exactly great on the performance side of things. That said, it seems to blame a fair bit of it on node_modules/.vite/react_dom_client.js, and I've no clue what to make of that.
